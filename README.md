Thanks for checking out AstroGreg, the revolutionized SpaceBlock modpack!



AstroGreg is a unique 1.20 “SpaceBlock” modpack built around space travel and GTCEu progression.



Start off stranded in the kuiper belt with sparse resources and work your way up out of the Milky Way through carefully thought out progression!



Progression primarily incorporates overhauled Ad Astra space travel and the classic GTCEu journey to bring you a high quality modpack experience.



Its an easier difficulty GregTech pack, but it's an intermediate modpack overall.
