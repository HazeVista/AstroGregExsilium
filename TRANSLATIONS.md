## Adding Translations to AstroGreg:Exsilium



First figure out what lang file your language uses, theres a list of them in this repository with examples:



[Example Lang File Repo](https://github.com/toxicity188/all-minecraft-language/tree/main)



next, find the en_us.json files you would like to translate from one of our associated projects:



[Mod Pack Assets](https://github.com/HazeVista/AstroGregExsilium/tree/main/kubejs/assets)
[Core Mod](https://github.com/HazeVista/AstroCore/blob/main/src/generated/resources/assets/astrogreg/lang/en_us.json)
[Botania Integration Mod](https://github.com/HazeVista/GTCEu-Simple-Botania-Integration/blob/main/src/generated/resources/assets/gtbotania/lang/en_us.json)
[GTCEu Terminals](https://github.com/BgameXL/GTCEu-Terminals/tree/main/src/main/resources/assets/gtceuterminal/lang)



Once you’ve made your translations and added them to a file with the associated lang file, you can Pull Request it to the Mod Pack GitHub under the lang folder associated with the mod you’re translating for (i.e. kubejs/assets/mod_id/lang/*).
For GTCEu Terminals, please Pull Request that directly to the mod itself.



Alternatively, if you don’t quite understand the file structure or GitHub, feel free to ping a Developer in our [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/dUaZeV6Drp) to review and add your translation files.



Thank you for your time and contributions, the AGE Team appreciates it!
